        I am a junior at the University of Southern Californiaâ€™s Viterbi School of Engineering. I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Business Finance and a specialization in Blockchain. I aim to leverage my expansive technical knowledge and knack for problem-solving to develop creative technical solutions to societal dilemmas. I have a strong foundation in C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS/JS, and ReactJS, and I have utilized these languages through academic, personal, and research projects. <br /> <br/ > I have also been privileged to participate in undergraduate research in socially assistive robotics. Through this experience, I have explored the intersection of psychology and technology, gaining technical skills and deepening my understanding of complex human behavior. <br /> <br /> In my free time, I am an avid tennis player, podcast listener, self-proclaimed coffee aficionado, and very invested in sustainable fashion. In the future, I hope to continue to explore human-computer interaction through research and industry opportunities.
